Name: 		CNREZ
Descripcion: 	Simple container sample in PM window
Date: 		2023-05-25
Version:	1.01
----------------------------  

DESCRIPTION
-----------
CNREZ.EXE is a sample program that demonstrates setting up a simple container.
It creates a standard window with a container as a child of the client window.
Once created, records are inserted into the container and the window is
displayed.

Child records are created under each top-level record to demonstrate the Tree
view.

Once the container is displayed, Name, Icon, Detail and Text views are
selectable from an actionbar pulldown. Simple direct-editing is enabled.

This sample is meant to demonstrate the setting up of a container and nothing
more. Drag/drop, Context Menus, Shared records, Deltas, Ownerdraw are just some
of the things *not* covered here. I hope to upload a sample with these features
at a later date.

DISCLAIMER: This program intentionally does no error-checking and uses global
variables. This is to provide an easy to understand program flow. I do not like
to code this way and had to kick myself several times while coding it, but the
clarity is better this way.

Hopefully CNREZ will be of some use to beginning container programmers.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
- yum install git gcc make libc-devel binutils watcom-wrc watcom-wlink-hll

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
This version of this sample was modified to compile on ArcaOS with GCC 9 compiler. 

1) Remember to have correct header files your path. For GCC the correct ones are the included on the "libc-devel", not the ones from the OS/2 Toolkit. Check your config.sys for "SET INCLUDE=C:\usr\include"

2) Since I'm using the Watcom Resource Compiler (open source) instead of the classic rc.exe, and the the Watcom Linker, intead of the classic ilink.exe, add to your config.sys...
 SET EMXOMFLD_LINKER=wl.exe
 SET EMXOMFLD_TYPE=WLINK
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC_TYPE=WRC
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC=wrc.exe

3) Run "make" or "make 2>&1 |tee make.out" to get the log file.


TOOLS USED
----------
- ArcaOS	- Verion 5.0.7
- wrc 		- Version 2.0beta1
- gcc		- gcc (GCC) 9.2.0 20190812 (OS/2 RPM build 9.2.0-5.oc00)
- make 		- Version 3.81 k2 (2017-11-10)

TROUBLESHOOT
------------
The compile produce will run by just executing make on the directory, but a compile.cmd file is includes to store the log in a file. If you want to save the log file you can run it as "nmake 2>&1 |tee make.out". The log will be saved into the "make.out" file.
